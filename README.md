# nl-switch

A simple night-light-switch tool that should reduce eye strain for insomniac users of XFCE.

## Install
```bash
sudo make
```
This will create a desktop application. If the application is added as a launcher on the panel, the on/off state of the nl-switch should dynamically change the launcher's icon.

## Remove
```bash
sudo make remove
```
